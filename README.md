# documents-page-proto

## Dummy app with 2 screens :

• One "upload" screen that allows testing all the document upload methods

• One "State" screen that allows visualizing the state of document verification

## The important parts  are :

• The blinkID folder, shows you right away how to configure and instanciate the microblink scanner. I really wouldn't recommend spending time on their shitty documentation.

• `UploadScreen.tsx` : shows you how to use the scanner

• `StateScreen.tsx` : shows you how all the brigader data should be interpreted

Don't mind the rest !!! :D
